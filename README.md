# Hadiqa's-Blog
As a tech blogger, I want a user-friendly CMS-style website to easily publish articles and opinions. When interacting with the site:

- The homepage displays existing posts, links to the dashboard, and a login option.
- Clicking on the homepage or other links prompts sign-up or sign-in.
- Signing up involves creating a username and password, granting access to the site.
- Subsequent visits require signing in, revealing navigation links and the option to log out.
- The homepage showcases post titles and creation dates. Clicking on a post reveals its contents, creator’s username, and date.
-Commenting on posts updates the post with the comment and creator’s details.
-The dashboard shows existing posts and an option to add new content.
-Adding a new post requires a title and contents, redirecting to an updated dashboard.
-Within the dashboard, I can delete or update existing posts.
-Logging out from the navigation successfully signs me out.
-Extended inactivity allows viewing posts but prompts a login before adding, updating, or deleting content.
